Camera Script based on QB Core.
Requested by someone on the RPUK Discord, can be changed dependent on the Framework of course.

This script expects an item to trigger its functionality (in specific I added a DSLR Camera item to my development server for it.)

In addition to it being simplistic it also includes the ability to upload photos taken with the camera directly to Discord via webhook.
